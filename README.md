# About:

Raspberry Pi - Mini PC
By Sean Allgaier

This is a mini "PC" running on a Raspberry Pi 4b and was made with 3D printed parts and cheap components bought off of AliExpress and other cheap electronics retailers.

Yes, it is a fully functional computer with working ports and a functional mini keyboard to go along with it. (If the included keyboard is too small you can always plug in any regular usb keyboard).

This was built as a 2024 christmas gift for my girlfriend <3
